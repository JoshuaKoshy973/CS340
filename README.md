Throughout this course, I learned how to design programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following clear coding standards and separating functionality into reusable modules. In Project One, I created a CRUD Python module that handled all database interactions. This separation of concerns made it a lot easier to connect the dashboard widgets in Project Two without rewriting or duplicating logic. The main advantage of working in this way was that when the database connection or query logic needed updates, I only had to make changes in the CRUD module rather than across the entire project. This approach makes code simpler to maintain, improves readability for future developers, and allows the module to be reused in other projects where similar database operations are needed.

As a computer scientist, I try to approach problems by breaking them into smaller, logical components. For Grazioso Salvares requirements, I analyzed the data structure, identified what queries were necessary to meet the dashboards needs, and then designed widgets to display those results interactively. Compared to earlier assignments in other courses, this project made me to think more like a professional developer working with a client, making sure that the features directly matched their business goals. Going forward, I would continue to use techniques like modular design, query optimization, and incremental testing to create databases and dashboards that adapt to different client requests efficiently.

Computer scientists play a really important role in solving real world problems by designing systems that improve how organizations use data. This matters because businesses and nonprofits depend on accurate, accessible information to make decisions. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, my dashboard project would help them quickly identify the types of rescues performed and filter information to allocate resources effectively. By providing a clear, interactive view of their data, my work could directly support their mission.
